There are four rules to tell whether a variable is in a local scope or global scope:

1.   If a variable is being used in the global scope (that is, outside of all functions), then it is always a global variable.

2.   If there is a global statement for that variable in a function, it is a global variable.

3.   Otherwise, if the variable is used in an assignment statement in the function, it is a local variable.

4.   But if the variable is not used in an assignment statement, it is a global variable.
